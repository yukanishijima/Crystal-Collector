# Crystal Collector

[Live](https://yukanishijima.github.io/unit-4-game/)

Click it, guess it, add it and collect it! 

## Site Functionality and Features

At the start of the game, a user will be given a random target number between 19 - 120 and 4 crystals, all of which has a random hidden number between 1 - 12.  

A user will click on a crystal to add a number to his score.  

A user wins when his score matches the target score. The user loses when his score goes above the target score.  

When a user wins or losses, the game will restart and display a new random target number and each crystal will have a new hidden number.  

The “how to play” button will show a user the game instruction in a modal window.  

The game is fully responsive for mobile and laptop.
